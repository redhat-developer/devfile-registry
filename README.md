Source repository for the Red Hat product devfile registry

This product devfile registry is updated weekly, by 12pm EST Wednesdays, with any updated stacks in this repository.

## Registry Updates

The staging product devfile registry is refreshed upon each commit to main in this repository. Production is promoted manually and as mentioned above, is done each Wednesday, as needed.

If you are a stack owner and need to request an urgent refresh of the registry service before Wednesday (for example if a stack is broken), please open an issue in this repository outlining the following:

- Stack name
- Why the refresh is needed
- Why the refresh cannot wait until the next regularly scheduled refresh

## Developing

### Prerequisites
